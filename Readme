AQI

This repository provides tools and scripts to track, analyze, and visualize air quality data. It includes features for fetching real-time data from APIs, calculating AQI, and generating reports or dashboards. Supports multiple data sources and provides customizable thresholds for different regions and pollutants.

Air Quality Monitoring System with Arduino and ThingSpeak

This project uses multiple gas sensors with an Arduino UNO and an Ethernet Shield to measure air quality and upload the data to ThingSpeak for real-time visualization and analysis.

Description

This project reads data from multiple MQ-series gas sensors and a DHT-11 temperature/humidity sensor. The collected data is sent to ThingSpeak for online monitoring and visualization.

Supported Sensors:

    MQ-9: CO, LPG, Methane
    MQ-8: Hydrogen (H₂)
    MQ-5: LPG, CO, Propane
    MQ-135: Smoke, CO₂
    MQ-4: Methane, CNG
    MQ-6: LPG, Propane
    DHT-11: Temperature and Humidity

 Hardware Components

    Arduino UNO
    Ethernet Shield (W5100)
    Gas Sensors (MQ-9, MQ-8, MQ-5, MQ-135, MQ-4, MQ-6)
    DHT-11 Temperature/Humidity Sensor
    Jumper Wires
    Breadboard

Software and Libraries

    Arduino IDE
    ThingSpeak Library
    Ethernet Library

Required Libraries:

Install these libraries using the Arduino Library Manager (Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries):

Installation and Setup

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/air-quality-monitor.git
cd air-quality-monitor

Configure ThingSpeak:

    Sign up at ThingSpeak.

    Create a new channel and note the Channel ID and Write API Key.

    Update the following constants in the code with your details:

    #define SECRET_CH_ID 2731380                   // Your ThingSpeak Channel ID
    #define SECRET_WRITE_APIKEY "YOUR_WRITE_API_KEY"

    Upload Code to Arduino:
        Connect the Arduino to your PC.
        Open the project in the Arduino IDE.
        Select the correct board and port (Tools -> Board -> Arduino UNO).
        Click Upload.

Code Explanation

    Gas Sensors Configuration:
    Reads values from different MQ sensors, calculates gas concentrations in ppm, and sends data to ThingSpeak.

    Ethernet Configuration:
    Uses DHCP or a static IP to connect the Ethernet Shield to the network.

    ThingSpeak Integration:
    Sends sensor readings to ThingSpeak fields for real-time monitoring.

ThingSpeak Fields Mapping:
Field 	Gas Measurement
Field 1 	Hydrogen (H₂)
Field 2 	LPG
Field 3 	Smoke
Field 4 	Carbon Monoxide (CO)
Field 7 	Propane
